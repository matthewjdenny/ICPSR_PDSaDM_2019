Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the  United States of America in Congress assembled, SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.     This Act may be cited as the ``Digital Coast Act of 2014. SEC. 2. FINDINGS.     Congress makes the following findings:             (1) The Digital Coast is a model approach for effective          Federal partnerships with State and local government,          nongovernmental organizations, and the private sector.             (2) Access to current, accurate, uniform, and standards-         based geospatial information, tools, and training to          characterize the United States coastal region is critical for          public safety and for the environment, infrastructure, and          economy of the United States.             (3) More than half of all people of the United States          (153,000,000) currently live on or near a coast and an          additional 12,000,000 are expected in the next decade.             (4) Coastal counties in the United States average 300          persons per square mile, compared with the national average of          98.             (5) On a typical day, more than 1,540 permits for          construction of single-family homes are issued in coastal          counties, combined with other commercial, retail, and          institutional construction to support this population.             (6) Over half of the economic productivity of the United          States is located within coastal regions.             (7) Highly accurate, high-resolution remote sensing and          other geospatial data play an important role in management of          the coastal zone and economy, including for--                     (A) flood and coastal storm surge prediction;                     (B) hazard risk and vulnerability assessment;                     (C) emergency response and recovery planning;                     (D) community resilience to longer range climate                  change impacts;                     (E) permitting and zoning decisionmaking;                     (F) habitat and ecosystem health assessments; and                     (G) landscape change detection.
