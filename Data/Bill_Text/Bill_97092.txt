This Act may be cited as the ``Exercise and Fitness For All Act. SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.     (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:             (1) Individuals with disabilities can maintain and improve          their health through appropriate physical activity.             (2) In the 2008 Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans          (referred to as the ``Guidelines), the Department of Health          and Human Services recommends that individuals with          disabilities, who are able, participate in regular aerobic          activity.             (3) The Guidelines also recommend that adults with          disabilities, who are able, do muscle-strengthening activities          of moderate or high intensity on 2 or more days a week, as          these activities provide additional health benefits.             (4) The Guidelines recommend that when adults with          disabilities are not able to meet the Guidelines, they should          engage in regular physical activity according to their          abilities and avoid inactivity.             (5) Unfortunately, many individuals with disabilities are          unable to engage in the recommended exercise or fitness          activities due to the inaccessibility of exercise or fitness          equipment.             (6) Physical inactivity by adults with disabilities can          lead to increased risk for functional limitations and secondary          health conditions.     (b) Purpose.--The purposes of this Act are--             (1) to encourage exercise and fitness service providers to          provide accessible exercise and fitness equipment for          individuals with disabilities; and             (2) to provide guidance about the requirements necessary to          ensure that such exercise and fitness equipment is accessible          to, and usable by, individuals with disabilities.
