State demonstration grants for comprehensive opioid abuse                             response.SEC. 2. FINDINGS.    Congress finds the following:            (1) The abuse of heroin and prescription painkillers is         having a devastating effect on public health and safety in         communities across the United States. According to the Centers         for Disease Control and Prevention, drug overdose deaths now         surpass traffic crashes in the number of deaths caused by         injury in the United States. In 2011, an average of about 110         people in the United States died from drug overdose every day.            (2) Law enforcement officials and treatment experts         throughout the country report that many prescription opioid         users have turned to heroin as a cheaper or more easily         obtained alternative to prescription drugs.            (3) Opioid pain relievers are the most widely misused or         abused controlled prescription drugs (commonly referred to as         ``CPDs') and are involved in most CPD-related overdose         incidents. According to the Drug Abuse Warning Network         (commonly known as ``DAWN'), the estimated number of emergency         department visits involving nonmedical use of prescription         opiates or opioids increased by 112 percent, from 84,671 to         179,787, between 2006 and 2010.            (4) According to a report by the National Association of         State Alcohol and Drug Abuse Directors (commonly referred to as         ``NASADAD'), 37 States reported an increase in admissions to         treatment for heroin use during the past 2 years, while         admissions to treatment for prescription opiates increased 500         percent from 2000 to 2012.            (5) Addiction is a treatable disease. Discoveries in the         science of addiction have led to advances in the treatment of         substance use disorders that help people stop abusing drugs and         prescription medications and resume their productive lives.            (6) According to the Office of National Drug Control Policy         (commonly referred to as ``ONDCP'), approximately 22,700,000         people in the United States needed substance use disorder         treatment in 2013, but only 2,500,000 people received it.            (7) Effective substance abuse prevention can yield major         economic dividends. Every dollar invested in prevention can         lead to savings between $2 and $20.            (8) According to the National Institute on Drug Abuse, when         schools and communities properly implement science-validated         substance abuse prevention programs, alcohol, tobacco, and         illicit drug abuse are reduced. Such programs help teachers,         parents, and healthcare professionals shape the perceptions of         youths about the risks of drug abuse.            (9) Diverting individuals with substance use disorders from         criminal justice systems into community-based treatment can         save billions of dollars and prevent sizeable numbers of         crimes, arrests, and re-incarcerations over the course of those         individuals lives.             (10) According to the Drug Enforcement Agency, more than          1,700 tons of expired, unwanted prescription medications have          been collected over the past 3\1/2\ years, following the          enactment of the Secure and Responsible Drug Disposal Act of          2010 (Public Law 111-273; 124 Stat. 2858).             (11) Research shows that combining treatment medications          with behavioral therapy is the best way to ensure success for          most patients. Treatment approaches must be tailored to address          the drug abuse patterns and drug-related medical, psychiatric,          and social problems of each individual. Different types of          medications may be useful at different stages of treatment to          help a patient stop abusing drugs, stay in treatment, and avoid          relapse.             (12) Research indicates that combating the epidemic of          opioid abuse, including abuse of prescription painkillers and,          increasingly, heroin, requires a multi-pronged approach that          involves reducing drug diversion, expanding delivery of          existing treatments (including medication assisted treatments),          expanding access to overdose medications and interventions, and          the development of new medications for pain that can augment          the existing treatment arsenal.
