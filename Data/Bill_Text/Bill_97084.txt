Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the  United States of America in Congress assembled, SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.     This Act may be cited as the ``Incentives to Educate American  Children Act of 2014 or the ``I Teach Act of 2014. SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.     (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:             (1) The United States classrooms are increasingly filled          with less experienced teachers, as elderly teachers retire and          the retention rate among young teachers continues to decrease.          The most common number of years of teaching experience for          public school teachers has decreased from 15 years experience          in 1987-1988 to 5 years in 2011-2012. According to the most          recent data, 1,700,000 teachers, representing 45 percent of the          workforce, had less than 10 years of experience. Students          deserve teachers with more experience and training.             (2) Recent research confirms that additional years of          teaching experience at the same grade level (up to 20 years)          add a direct positive impact on student achievement.             (3) The most recent data (2011-2012) from the National          Center for Education Statistics find 32.8 percent of public          schools in the United States are in rural areas. The associated          costs rural schools face mean that they often have less money          for instructional costs and salaries. Department of Education          data show that rural school districts have the lowest base          salaries for starting teachers, a trend that continues even as          teachers move to the top of the local salary range. Rural          schools face these challenges across the country.             (4) The most recent study by the Education Trust found that          high schools with high poverty rates are twice as likely to          have teachers that are not certified in their fields than high          schools with low poverty rates. The same study found that high          poverty schools have a higher percentage of first year          teachers. Rural schools face similar problems.             (5) According to the most recent statistics by the Bureau          of Labor Statistics and the Department of Education, teachers          are paid on average only 79 percent as much as other college          graduates.             (6) The National Board for Professional Teaching Standards          was founded in 1987 as a follow up to the landmark 1983 report,          ``A Nation at Risk, by the Carnegie Task Force on Teaching.          The National Board for Professional Teaching Standards is an          independent, nonprofit, and nonpartisan organization, whose          mission is to establish high and rigorous standards for what          accomplished teachers should know and be able to do.             (7) Over 100,000 teachers from all 50 States and the          District of Columbia have completed certification by the          National Board for Professional Teaching Standards, where          certification is a rigorous assessment process for teachers.             (8) The National Research Council (NRC) of the National          Academies has affirmed that students taught by National Board          certified teachers make higher gains on achievement tests than          those taught by teachers who have not applied for or have not          achieved certification.             (9) According to the National Commission on Teaching and          Americas Future, 15.7 percent of teachers leave their jobs         each year, compared to an annual turnover rate of 11.9 percent         in other professions. The average cost of recruiting, hiring,         preparing, and losing a teacher is approximately $50,000.            (10) The NRC found in 2008 that the average retention rate         for National Board certified teachers is higher than the rate         for teachers who have not achieved certification. Specifically,         in a study focusing on the first 4 to 7 years of teaching, the         NRC found that nearly \3/4\ of National Board certified         teachers remained in the profession at the end of the study,         compared to only \2/3\ of non-certified teachers that stayed         teaching during the same time period.    (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are as follows:            (1) To encourage teachers, through a refundable tax credit,         to work in public elementary and secondary schools located in         rural areas or schools with high poverty.            (2) To provide an additional tax credit to teachers who         achieve certification from the National Board for Professional         Teaching Standards in order to recruit and retain highly         qualified teachers in public elementary and secondary schools.SEC. 3.
