Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the  United States of America in Congress assembled, SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.     This Act may be cited as the ``In-Home Caregiver Assessment  Resources and Education Act or the ``In-Home CARE Act. SEC. 2. FINDINGS.     Congress finds the following:             (1) More than 65,000,000 unpaid caregivers provide care for          a chronically ill, disabled, or aged family member or friend          during any given year.             (2) Sixty-six percent of unpaid caregivers are women. More          than 37 percent of caregivers live with children or          grandchildren who are under 18 years old.             (3) Unpaid family caregivers spend an average of 20 hours          per week caring for their loved ones, and 13 percent of family          caregivers provide 40 or more hours of care per week.             (4) Thirty-six percent of caregivers care for a parent.             (5) Fourteen percent of caregivers care for a special needs          child, including an estimated 16,800,000 caregivers who care          for special needs children who are under 18 years old.             (6) In 2007, the average caregiver for someone 50 years or          older spent $5,531 per year on out-of-pocket caregiving          expenses, which is more than 10 percent of the median income          for a family caregiver for that year. Forty-seven percent of          working caregivers have used up all or most of their savings          due to caregiving expenses.             (7) Seventy-three percent of caregivers who provide care          for an individual over the age of 18 are currently working or          have worked while providing care. Sixty-six percent of such          caregivers have had to make some modifications to their work          schedule, from arriving late to work to leaving their job          entirely. One in 5 caregivers have had to take time off from          work.             (8) Fifty-three percent of caregivers have experienced a          decline in their health as a result of caregiving, which has          affected their ability to provide care.             (9) Forty-six percent of caregivers perform medical or          nursing tasks for patients with multiple physical and chronic          conditions. Of these caregivers, 78 percent were in charge of          managing a patients medications, administering fluids, or         administering injections.            (10) Nearly 20 percent of caregivers who assisted with         medication management and 33 percent who assisted with changing         dressings or bandages received no training about how to perform         these tasks.            (11) The vast majority (78 percent) of caregivers indicated         they need more support related to caregiving.            (12) Home visiting programs are cost-effective and have         been proven to improve outcomes for children and parents in         different domains ranging from child development to family         violence.SEC. 3. PURPOSES.    The purposes of this Act are--            (1) to improve the ability of unpaid caregivers to care for         individuals in the home; and            (2) to increase opportunities for individuals who are in         need of care to remain at home and reduce or postpone the need         for such individuals to receive care at an institution.SEC. 4.
