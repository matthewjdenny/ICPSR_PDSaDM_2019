Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the  United States of America in Congress assembled, SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.     This Act may be cited as the ``Caregiver Corps Act of 2014. SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.     (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:             (1) As of 2013, more than 43,000,000 Americans are age 65          or older. More than 75 percent of such individuals live with          chronic conditions which require assistance that helps them to          live in a home- or community-based setting. In 2012, almost          38,000,000 Americans of all ages reported having one or more          disabilities.             (2) As of 2012, there were over 800,000 home health aides          assisting older adults in their homes with activities of daily          living and some light housekeeping tasks such as changing          linens and preparing food. Direct care workers are critical as          families and friends strive to provide quality care for          individuals in the community.             (3) Estimates suggest that there are 52,000,000 to          65,000,000 informal caregivers helping to provide care to          adults with disabilities and illnesses. These caregivers help          with a range of tasks but more time is spent on tasks such as          shopping, food preparation, housekeeping, and laundry, and less          time is spent on activities of daily living such as feeding,          dressing, grooming, walking, bathing, and assistance toileting.             (4) Over 60 percent of all informal caregivers work either          full- or part-time. Even with the growing number of direct care          workers available, there is a shortage in the number of people          available to help support individuals who need extra assistance          to remain in the community.             (5) Only 12 percent of informal caregivers report having          used a respite service. Respite is a means of giving the          caregiver a break from their caregiving duties. Respite comes          in many forms and may include having the individual attend an          adult day program outside the home or having a friendly visitor          serve as a companion and provide light assistance while the          caregiver takes a break.             (6) Respite volunteer programs exist in many communities.          There is a range of ways that these programs offer incentives          to the volunteers. Some programs use a time-banking or service-         exchange approach as an incentive to engage volunteers, while          other programs access funds from private and public sources to          offer modest stipends to volunteers.     (b) Purpose.--It is the purpose of this Act to establish a  Caregiver Corps program to foster the creation of community-based Corps  programs that provide for volunteer community service opportunities to  address the shortage of assistance available for older adults and  individuals with disabilities.
