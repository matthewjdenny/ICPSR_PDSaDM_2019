Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the  United States of America in Congress assembled, SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.     This Act may be cited as the ``Naugatuck River Valley National  Heritage Area Study Act. SEC. 2. NATIONAL PARK SERVICE STUDY REGARDING NAUGATUCK RIVER VALLEY,                CONNECTICUT.     (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:             (1) The area that encompasses the Naugatuck River Valley of          Connecticut has made a unique contribution to the cultural,          political, and industrial development of the United States.             (2) The Naugatuck River Valley is comprised of 14          communities along the Naugatuck River, which stretches for more          than 40 miles from its headwaters in Torrington, Connecticut,          to the confluence with the Housatonic River in Shelton. The 14          municipalities of Torrington, Harwinton, Litchfield, Plymouth/         Terryville, Thomaston, Waterbury, Watertown, Ansonia, Beacon          Falls, Derby, Naugatuck, Oxford, Seymour, and Shelton, share          common historical elements, agricultural, trade, and maritime          origins, similar architecture, common industries, an immigrant          culture succeeding colonial beginnings, and a significant          contribution to the war effort from the Revolutionary War to          World War II. Most of these elements are still in evidence          today.             (3) Three major industries drove the manufacturing          contribution of the Valley. As evidenced in the book, The Brass          Industry in the United States, by William Lathrop, the brass          industry was born in Connecticuts Naugatuck River Valley and         harnessed the power of the Naugatuck River and the skilled         immigrant workers who arrived from Germany, Ireland, Italy, and         Poland.            (4) The Naugatuck River Valley also spawned the birth of         the rubber industry in the United States when Charles Goodyear         developed the vulcanization process in 1839. Together with         Samuel Lewis, a wealthy industrialist from Naugatuck,         Connecticut, Goodyear parlayed his innovation into establishing         the U.S. Rubber Company, making Naugatuck the rubber capital of         the world.            (5) The Naugatuck River Valley was also a major contributor         to the success of the United States clock industry. Eli Terry         designed interchangeable parts for his clocks assembled in         Terryville. Renowned clockmaker Seth Thomas began making the         first of millions of clocks in Thomaston, Connecticut, in 1813.         His company continued until 1931 when it became a division of         General Time Corporation (Timex). Other important industries         included pens, evaporated milk, pianos and organs, corset         stays, and cables.            (6) The Naugatuck River Valley has been a major contributor         to the United States war efforts from the American Revolution         to the Civil War to World War II. In the 2007 PBS film ``The         War', the story of World War II directed and produced by Ken         Burns and Lynn Novick, the City of Waterbury, Connecticut, was         characterized as the ``arsenal' of the war effort because of         its high concentration of war industries.            (7) The Naugatuck River Valley has been home to many great         authors, diplomats, inventors and patriots, such as David         Humphreys, Aide-de-Camp to General George Washington and the         first American ambassador; Commodore Isaac Hull, Commander of         ``Old Ironsides' during the War of 1812; Ebenezer D. Bassett,         the countrys first black ambassador; Dr. John Howe, inventor          of a pin making machine that made the common pin a household          necessity; and Pierre Lallement, inventor of the modern two-         wheel bicycle.             (8) The Naugatuck River Valley possesses a rich and diverse          assemblage of architecturally significant civic, industrial and          residential structures and monuments dating from Colonial times          to the present. There are 88 structures in the Naugatuck Valley          included on the National Register of Historic Places. The first          law school in America was built in Litchfield. Notable examples          of the variety of architecture found in the Valley include          Robert Wakeman Hills brilliantly designed Thomaston Opera         House and Town Hall; H.E. Fickens acoustically impressive          Sterling Opera House in Derby, site of appearances by many          nationally known performers; Waterburys Clock Tower, designed         by the renowned architectural firm of McKim, Mead &amp; White which         also designed four buildings in Naugatuck; Henry Bacon,         designer of the Lincoln Memorial and two structures in         Naugatuck; and the Father McGivney Statue cast by Joseph         Coletti of Boston to honor the Waterburian who founded the         Knights of Columbus.            (9) The Naugatuck River Valley has been a melting pot for         immigrant populations who have made significant contributions         to the industrial, cultural, and economic development of the         nation.            (10) The Naugatuck River Valley possesses a group of         public-spirited citizens dedicated to the preservation and         promotion of the regions natural, historic, and cultural          heritage, and a passionate resolve to work together for the          betterment of the Valley and its residents.
