Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the  United States of America in Congress assembled, SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.     This Act may be cited as the ``Economic Growth and Development  Act. SEC. 2. FINDINGS.     Congress makes the following findings:             (1) The promotion of sustainable economic growth is the          only long-term solution to lifting people out of poverty and          addressing development challenges such as infectious disease,          food security, education, and access to clean water.             (2) Several of the greatest development success stories in          the last 50 years demonstrate how private sector investment and          economic growth are fundamental to lifting populations out of          poverty.             (3) There has been a dramatic shift in the composition of          capital flows to the developing world. Whereas 40 years ago          more than 70 percent of capital flowing to developing countries          was public sector foreign assistance, today 87 percent of          capital flowing to the developing world comes from the private          sector.             (4) Eleven of the 15 largest importers of United States          goods and services are countries that graduated from United          States foreign assistance, and 12 of the 15 fastest growing          markets for United States exports are former United States          foreign assistance recipients.             (5) With 12 departments, 26 agencies, and more than 60          Federal Government offices all involved in the delivery of          United States foreign assistance, it is extremely difficult for          United States businesses to navigate the bureaucracy in search          of opportunities to partner with such United States agencies.             (6) Although many United States development agencies have          taken steps to improve their private sector coordination          capabilities in recent years, these agency-specific strategies          remain opaque and must be integrated into a coherent          interagency coordination structure to engage the private          sector.             (7) President Barack Obamas 2010 Policy Directive on         Global Development created an Interagency Policy Committee         (IPC) for Global Development. However, the IPC has not yet         established a streamlined, interagency mechanism for         coordination with the private sector.            (8) In order to better leverage United States foreign         assistance dollars and to promote sustainable economic         development in partner countries, the private sector should be         consulted during development planning and programming         processes.            (9) Whether it is in the context of country, sector, or         global development strategy, decisions on program         prioritization and resource allocations would benefit greatly         from private sector perspectives and market data.            (10) By consulting with the private sector from the outset,         development programs can be designed to better attract private         sector investment and to promote public-private partnerships in         key development sectors.            (11) The Millennium Challenge Corporation and the         Partnership for Growth both analyze constraints to growth as         part of their planning processes, but these analyses need to be         included in agency country, sector, and global development         strategies to more effectively inform and guide the full         spectrum of United States development programs.SEC. 3.
