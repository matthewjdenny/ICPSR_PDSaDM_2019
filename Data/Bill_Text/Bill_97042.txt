Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the  United States of America in Congress assembled, SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.     This Act may be cited as the ``United States Optimal Use of Trade  to Develop Outerwear and Outdoor Recreation Act or the ``U.S. OUTDOOR  Act. SEC. 2. FINDINGS.     Congress finds the following:             (1) The outdoor industry generates $646,000,000,000 in          consumer spending annually and directly supports 6,000,000          jobs.             (2) Outdoor activities are vitally important to the health          and well-being of the people of the United States.             (3) Duty rates on recreational performance apparel are          among the highest duty rates imposed by the United States          Government, with duties on some recreational performance          apparel as high as 28.2 percent.             (4) The duties currently imposed by the United States on          recreational performance apparel were set in an era during          which high rates of duty were intended to protect the          production of other apparel in the United States, and before          the technologies and innovations that create todays         recreational performance apparel industry were developed.            (5) In July 2007, the United States International Trade         Commission confirmed, in USITC Publication 3937, that         recreational performance apparel produced in the United States         makes up less than 1 percent of the total recreational         performance apparel market.            (6) The elimination of duties on the importation of certain         recreational performance apparel would provide an economic         benefit to United States consumers of outdoor products and         would promote increased participation in healthy and active         lifestyles.SEC. 3.

In a jacket, such         openings are often positioned on the underarm seam of a garment         but may also be placed along other seams in the front or back         of a garment. In trousers, such openings are often positioned         on the inner or outer leg seams of a garment but may also be         placed along other seams in the front or back of a garment.            ``(vii) The term `articulated elbows or knees refers to          the construction of a sleeve (or pant leg) to allow improved          mobility at the elbow (or knee) through the use of extra seams,          darts, gussets, or other means.             ``(viii) The term `reinforcement refers to the use of a         double layer of fabric or section(s) of fabric that is         abrasion-resistant or otherwise more durable than the face         fabric of the garment.            ``(ix) The term `weatherproof closure means a closure          (including, but not limited to, laminated or coated zippers,          storm flaps, or other weatherproof construction) that has been          reinforced or engineered in a manner to reduce the penetration          or absorption of moisture or air through an opening in the          garment.             ``(x) The term `multi-adjustable hood or adjustable collar         means, in the case of a hood, a hood into which is incorporated         two or more draw cords, adjustment tabs, or elastics, or, in         the case of a collar, a collar into which is incorporated at         least one draw cord, adjustment tab, elastic, or similar         component, to allow volume adjustments around a helmet, or the         crown of the head, neck, or face.            ``(xi) The terms `adjustable powder skirt and `inner          protective skirt refer to a partial lower inner lining with         means of tightening around the waist for additional protection         from the elements.            ``(xii) The term `arm gusset means construction at the arm          of a gusset that utilizes an extra fabric piece in the          underarm, usually diamond- or triangular-shaped, designed, or          patterned to allow radial arm movement.             ``(xiii) The term `radial arm movement refers to         unrestricted, 180-degree range of motion for the arm while         wearing performance outerwear.            ``(xiv) The term `odor control technology means the          incorporation into a fabric or garment of materials, including,          but not limited to, activated carbon, silver, copper, or any          combination thereof, capable of adsorbing, absorbing, or          reacting with human odors, or effective in reducing the growth          of odor-causing bacteria.             ``(xv) The term `occupational outerwear means outerwear         garments, including uniforms, designed or marketed for use in         the workplace or at a worksite to provide durable protection         from cold or inclement weather and/or workplace hazards, such         as fire, electrical, abrasion, or chemical hazards, or impacts,         cuts, punctures, or similar hazards.    ``3. For purposes of this chapter, the importer of record shall maintain internal import records that specify upon entry whether garments claimed as recreational performance outerwear have an outer surface that is water resistant, treated with plastics, or a combination thereof, and shall further enumerate the specific features that make the garments eligible to be classified as recreational performance outerwear.'.
