Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the  United States of America in Congress assembled, SECTION 1. FINDINGS.     Congress finds the following:             (1) June 21, 2014, marks 50 years since the lives of James          Chaney, Andrew Goodman, and Michael Schwerner were brutally          taken on the basis of racism and hatred.             (2) Chaney, Goodman, and Schwerner were assisting Congress          of Racial Equality in Mississippi during the Freedom Summer of          1964, wherein they risked their lives leading voting          registration efforts for people who were denied the right to          vote.             (3) Chaney, Goodman, and Schwerner were imprisoned in          Neshoba County, Mississippi, without due process and released          into the dead of the night into the hands of Klansmen.             (4) The disappearance of these devoted civil rights          activists captured national attention and led to an          investigation by the Federal Bureau of Investigation.             (5) Following a 44-day search by Federal agents, the grim          remains of James Chaney, Andrew Goodman, and Michael Schwerner          were discovered in an earthen dam.             (6) This tragedy galvanized momentum for the Civil Rights          Movement and helped to secure the passage of the Civil Rights          Act of 1964 and later the Voting Rights Act of 1965 and led to          the first permanent Federal Bureau of Investigation field          office in the State of Mississippi.             (7) Justice was delayed 41 years, to the day, for these          three brave men and their families until a Neshoba County jury          found 1 of the 18 men originally charged in the case guilty on          three counts of murder.             (8) These three valiant activists are representative of          countless individuals who lost their lives on a quest for          justice and equality, including Henry Hezekiah Dee and Charles          Eddie More whose bodies were also found during the massive          search for Chaney, Goodman, and Schwerner.             (9) Chaney, Goodman, and Schwerners legacy of advocacy and         unyielding resolve for justice in the face of peril is one that         continues to be embodied in young adults across this great         country.            (10) It is befitting that Congress bestow the highest         civilian honor, the Congressional Gold Medal, in 2014 to James         Chaney, Andrew Goodman, and Michael Schwerner, posthumously in         recognition of the 50th commemoration of their kidnapping and         subsequent murders.SEC. 2.
