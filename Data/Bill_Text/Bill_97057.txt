[Congressional Bills  113th Congress] [From the U.S. Government Printing Office] [S. 2853 Introduced in Senate (IS)] 113th CONGRESS   2d Session                                 S. 2853  To implement policies to end preventable maternal, newborn, and child                              deaths globally. _______________________________________________________________________                    IN THE SENATE OF THE UNITED STATES                            September 18, 2014   Mr. Coons (for himself, Mr. Graham, and Mr. Cardin) introduced the   following bill; which was read twice and referred to the Committee on                             Foreign Relations _______________________________________________________________________                                  A BILL    To implement policies to end preventable maternal, newborn, and child                              deaths globally.     Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the  United States of America in Congress assembled, SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.     This Act may be cited as the ``Accelerating Action in Maternal and  Child Health Act of 2014. SEC. 2. PURPOSE.     The purpose of this Act is to provide tools for the United States  Government to use to accelerate the reduction of preventable maternal,  newborn, and child deaths in 24 United States Agency for International  Development (USAID) focus countries by 2020, saving 15,000,000 children  and 600,000 mothers. SEC. 3. FINDINGS.     Congress makes the following findings:             (1) Over the past 2 decades, child mortality has reduced by          nearly 50 percent and maternal mortality has reduced by 40          percent, thanks in large part to United States Government          action and intervention.             (2) In the last 3 years, 24 priority countries--of which 16          are in Africa--have achieved an 8 percent reduction in under-5          mortality, saving 500,000 lives.             (3) The report ``Acting on the Call: Ending Preventable          Child and Maternal Deaths developed by USAID provides a          critical foundation of evidence, knowledge, modeling, and          policy development on ending maternal, newborn, and child          deaths worldwide.             (4) To achieve Millennium Development Goal 4--to reduce          child mortality by \2/3\ between 1990 and 2015--on time, the          global annual rate of reduction in under-5 mortality would need          to rise to 15.6 percent from 2012 through 2015, much faster          than the 3.9 percent achieved from 2005 through 2012.             (5) According to the World Health Organization (WHO), every          year 6,600,000 children under the age of 5--primarily infants--         die from preventable or treatable causes, and more than 800          women die every day from complications during pregnancy and          childbirth.             (6) The vast majority of these deaths occur in the          developing world and countries in Africa have the highest          burden.             (7) The highest rates of child mortality are still in sub-         Saharan Africa, with an under-5 mortality rate of 98 deaths per          1,000 live births--more than 15 times the average for developed          regions.             (8) Investing in women and children reduces poverty,          stimulates economic growth, and most importantly, saves lives.             (9) Health products, such as vaccines and treatments, have          contributed significantly to recent successes in child and          maternal survival globally. New approaches and technologies are          critically needed to accelerate progress toward ending          preventable maternal and child deaths.             (10) The WHO identifies the following leading causes of          maternal, newborn, and child mortality:                     (A) Leading causes of maternal mortality in low-                 income countries include post-partum bleeding,                  infection, and hypertension.                     (B) Newborn deaths account for approximately 44                  percent of deaths among children under age 5 and are                  predominantly caused by infections, premature birth,                  and asphyxia.                     (C) Most deaths of children under the age of 5 are                  a result of preventable causes, such as respiratory                  infections (commonly from pneumonia), diarrhea, and                  malaria.                     (D) Malnutrition is the underlying contributing                  factor in about 45 percent of all child deaths, making                  children more vulnerable to severe diseases. SEC. 4. STATEMENT OF POLICY.     It is the policy of the United States, in partnership with host  governments, international financial institutions, nongovernmental  organizations, faith-based organizations, and the private sector, to  establish a comprehensive, coordinated, integrated strategy to combat  the leading causes of maternal, newborn, and child mortality globally  by--             (1) building on progress and success to date;             (2) scaling up the most effective evidence-based          interventions with a focus on country ownership;             (3) focusing on USAIDs 24 priority countries;            (4) streamlining existing resources and scaling up         increased targeted resources;            (5) increasing transparency and accountability; and            (6) creating innovative new public-private financing         mechanisms.SEC. 5. STRATEGY.

The strategy shall further strengthen the  capability of the United States to be an effective leader in maternal,  newborn, and child health, particularly in Africa, and will be a first  step toward a broader, concerted effort to end maternal, newborn, and  child deaths worldwide.     (b) Elements.--The strategy established under subsection (a)  shall--             (1) include specific objectives, multisectoral approaches,          and specific strategies to address the leading causes of death          among mothers during pregnancy, childbirth, and post-delivery;          newborns in their first 28 days; and children under the age of          5;             (2) clarify the responsibilities of the country, the          implementing organization, and the United States in the          achievement of such objectives;             (3) include regular benchmarks to measure, where          appropriate, progress toward achieving such objectives;             (4) utilize data and modeling to implement the most          effective interventions for saving 15,000,000 children and          600,000 mothers;             (5) illustrate the result of coordination among relevant          executive branch agencies, foreign governments, and          international organizations;             (6) provide projected levels of resources needed to achieve          the stated objectives;             (7) expand public-private partnerships for research and          innovation and for leveraging resources in new and innovative          ways; and             (8) use open, fair, and competitive procedures wherever          appropriate and possible in the administration, execution, and          evaluation of the program.     (c) Targeted Services.--The strategy established under subsection  (a) should focus on the following evidence-based categories of  intervention:             (1) Safe motherhood and newborn survival, including--                     (A) prenatal and postnatal care for mothers and                  newborns;                     (B) quality care during labor and delivery,                  including in emergencies; and                     (C) education on healthy timing and spacing of                  pregnancies.
