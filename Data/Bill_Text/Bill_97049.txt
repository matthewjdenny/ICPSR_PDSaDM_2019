Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the  United States of America in Congress assembled, SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.     This Act may be cited as the ``Southern Prairie Potholes National  Wildlife Refuge Act. SEC. 2. FINDINGS.     Congress finds that--             (1) the area of the State of Iowa known as the Southern          Prairie Potholes and consisting primarily of the Willow Creek          watershed in Greene County offers exceptional potential for          restoration into a bountiful native wildlife habitat area;             (2) ongoing restoration and preservation of this wildlife          habitat area will significantly enhance opportunities for          outdoor recreation in this region, including waterfowl and          upland hunting, wildlife viewing, and hiking;             (3) the Southern Prairie Potholes area is located at the          southwestern edge of the Des Moines Lobe left by glaciers          12,000 years ago;             (4) the sloughs and grassland offer a substantial oasis of          both wetland and grassland habitat at the southwestern boundary          of the most heavily cropped region in Iowa;             (5) because of the location of the Southern Prairie          Potholes at the edge of the multistate and international region          known as the Prairie Potholes Region, and along important          migratory flyways, the restoration and preservation of the area          is critical to providing wildlife habitat across the full          extent of the Prairie Potholes Region;             (6) this 23,500-acre area has for years been designated by          the Prairie Pothole Joint Venture as a priority area for          restoration and preservation because of the importance of the          area to wildlife, facilitating gradual public land acquisition          for habitat restoration;             (7) the area already includes the 2,134-acre Dunbar Slough          wetland complex of Federal and State land managed as popular          wildlife and hunting areas serving Carroll, Greene, and Guthrie          Counties and beyond;             (8) national wildlife refuges increasingly follow a mosaic          pattern with a core of publicly held land surrounded by          privately held land also located within the refuge boundary;             (9) private ownership and uses are not affected for private          land within the designated boundaries of the refuge, but          private landowners may be provided increased opportunities for          partnering on conservation or restoration practices;             (10) restoration and preservation of the Southern Prairie          Potholes area will benefit hundreds of birds, mammals,          butterflies, reptiles, and amphibians that have been classified          as species of greatest conservation need, including the          endangered Blandings turtle;            (11) restoration of grassland and wetland in the area will         contribute to improved flood control and water quality         downstream, as the Middle Raccoon River is the major water         source for the Des Moines metropolitan region and other         communities;            (12) the Southern Prairie Potholes area offers unique         recreational appeal because the area is adjacent to the         existing Whiterock Conservancy, a 4,300-acre land trust         dedicated to conserving and protecting the natural resources of         Iowa and engaging the public with the landscape;            (13) Whiterock Conservancy offers outdoor recreation and         education and includes a major new Backcountry Trail complex;            (14) the proximity of the Southern Prairie Potholes to the         largest metropolitan area in Iowa adds to the ability of the         area to provide natural resource experiences to a broad         community; and            (15) the area is already attracting cyclists, and that         appeal will grow with ongoing development of the cross-country         American Discovery Trail transecting the area.SEC. 3.
